# wordpress

## Installation

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/aminnairi/wordpress-docker.git ~/code/my-wordpress-app
$ cd ~/code/my-wordpress-app
```

Where `~/code/my-wordpress-app` is the path to where you want to have your Wordpress website.

## Start

```console
$ make start
```

***Note**: the server will be accessible on http://localhost:8080.*
***Note**: the databse client will be accessible on http://localhost:8081.*

If the server does not load up, give it up time. Wordpress is like a grandfather: it is not very fast.

$ make stop
```

## Restart

$ make restart
```
